                        Research being done by early-career scientists is an integral part of scientific innovation and, at the Abramson Cancer Center, many young investigators are already making a big impact on cancer research. We sat down with five of them to learn more about their research, how Penn's ecosystem helps foster their ideas and why philanthropic support is crucial to the future of cancer care.

Also, my mom and her sisters worked at a cancer hospice in Philadelphia, so for better or worse, cancer was always kind of my family business. From an early age, I understood the suffering that cancer caused for families, and I wanted to be part of changing that. I always wanted to understand: Why does this happen, and how can we prevent this from happening?

                            <strong class="blue">Dr. Maxwell:</strong> I also became motivated fairly young, specifically in regard to the genetics of cancer. I knew my father lost his mother to breast cancer when he was eight, and I saw the impact that early breast cancer had on a child's life from there on.

                            I was a senior in high school when BRCA1 was cloned, and because of the cancer history in my family, I got super interested in the fact that there was actually a genetic factor that might cause breast cancer and other cancers. Being able to do the human genetics work means I can take care of families who have very similar experiences to what my father's family went through&mdash;and hopefully help them out by telling them that not only can I provide them some support in the clinic, but I can also try to figure out why that cancer keeps occurring in their family.

I do translational genetics, and Penn is one of the few institutions that has a robust biobanking platform that allows us to recruit patients into studies for translational work. Also, it's a very collaborative environment. People are so open to working together, and that's something that I really don't think is present at other institutions to anywhere near the same level.

Early in my career at Penn, I received a few smaller philanthropic awards that gave me the ability to focus on research I was passionate about for my postdoc.

I received an Abramson Cancer Center pilot grant to explore a new, faster breast cancer screening modality for Black women. Most recently, I received a small grant to determine if spit kits are a feasible way to collect DNA. The funds were unrestricted and that allowed me to do a pilot project to gather preliminary data to prove that I could actually recruit patients for my proposed trial, and then apply for an NIH R01 grant to fund the larger study. Philanthropy helps a young investigator get started in a really important way.

                            With five treatment rooms and a dedicated research lab, the center operates as the world's largest hub for the integration of proton therapy and conventional radiation therapy. Every member of the center's team has specialized training and depth of experience in proton beam therapy, a type of radiation therapy whose high-energy radiation beams offer greater precision and accuracy in destroying cancer cells than that of conventional therapies.

                            Imagine cancer patients being able to receive an entire course of radiotherapy in a single rapid treatment rather than over the duration of weeks and months. That's FLASH radiotherapy, and according to the Abramson Cancer Center's research (the results of which were recently published in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics), it offers hope for the future of oncology.

                            Other advances in proton therapy at Penn include pencil beam scanning, in which the proton beam is mere millimeters wide and can be adjusted in intensity to deliver more radiation to targeted areas; and advanced imaging technology integrated into the proton therapy machines to calculate the most accurate radiation doses possible.

The foundation saw something special happening at Penn and, in bestowing a $12 million grant, helped catalyze efforts to a whole new level. Now, in collaboration with Penn's Abramson Cancer Center, it looks like their vision is becoming a reality. Scientists have figured out how to use proton radiation to generate the dosage needed to give a cancer patient an entire course of radiotherapy in a single, 1-second treatment. Known as FLASH, it's an experimental therapy that is still in its early stages, with the promise to have the same effect on tumors as traditional radiation&mdash;while sparing healthy tissue. This promising treatment could transform radiation therapy as we know it.</p>
