                    <p class="standard grey">To counter an environment of misinformation, Penn Medicine's Abramson Cancer Center affirmed its position as a trusted source of science and medicine across the nation, hosting a virtual conference in October 2020 on "Cancer and COVID-19" with keynote speaker Anthony Fauci, MD, Director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Fauci and other experts spoke to 1,900 healthcare professionals across the country about the rising rates of COVID-19 (the country had just surpassed 200,000 deaths a few days prior), updates on vaccine trials and advice for the oncology field.</p>
                    <p class="standard grey">Dr. Fauci urged cancer centers to resume regular prevention and screening efforts.</p>
                    <p class="standard grey">"From a 40,000-foot look, you should try to get back to the normal type of screening that you have done as quickly as you possibly can," Dr. Fauci told conference attendees. "I would use [COVID-19] testing to get back to where you want to be."</p>
                    <p class="standard grey">Penn Medicine's former Chief of Hematology-Oncology, Lynn M. Schuchter, MD, shared with participants the safety protocols our clinics had enacted.</p>
                    <p class="standard grey">"Our goal is to optimize patient and staff safety," she said. Penn Medicine has done just that through social distancing, mask-wearing and appropriate COVID-19 testing.</p>

                    <p class="standard white">Clinical trials are crucial to the <a href="#by-the-numbers" class="lighter-blue">advancement of cancer care</a>, allowing researchers to test not only new treatments but also prevention strategies and diagnostic techniques in clinical settings. They provide participants with access to the latest cancer drugs and treatment protocols. But, historically, it has been difficult to attract representative samples of the population to participate in trials. The need for frequent travel and visits to trial facilities has proven to be a significant barrier, especially for members of underserved communities.</p>
                    <p class="standard white">Even before the pandemic, Abramson Cancer Center researchers were contemplating ways to improve access and increase diversity in their clinical trials. Yet government regulations made moving the needle difficult. If there was a silver lining to 2020, it's that COVID-19 restrictions required federal regulators to allow researchers to test out practices that allowed them to continue their trials throughout the pandemic. That meant:</p>
                    <ul class="standard white">
                        <li>Enroll patients virtually as opposed to in person</li>
                        <li>Ship trial medications to patients' homes rather than having them come to the center to pick them up</li>
                        <li>Allow trial participants to have tests done closer to home at their doctor's offices instead of at the cancer center</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="in-content lighter-blue">Improved Patient Access</h3>
                    <p class="standard white">In addition to keeping patients safe by limiting interaction, these steps opened trials up to patients who would otherwise not be able to participate. Fewer required in-person visits means some patients only have to travel to the Abramson Cancer Center a few times a month as opposed to a few times per week.</p>
                    <p class="standard white">Abramson Cancer Center Director Robert Vonderheide, MD, DPhil, says he is hopeful the new practices will become permanent.</p>
                    <p class="standard white">"We've learned that certain demands we assumed to be the way a clinical trial has to work are challengeable," Dr. Vonderheide told the Association of American Medical Colleges. "We're rethinking doing clinical research in ways that the pandemic showed us were possible, safe and effective &mdash; and probably more cost-effective."</p>

                        It is difficult to maintain social distance when conducting most cancer screenings. Yet, we knew that it was vitally important to continue to screen for colorectal cancer in our community. The Abramson Cancer Center's solution: offer drive-thru clinics and partner with strong community organizations to publicize them and encourage people to use them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard grey">
                        The clinics, held between fall 2020 and spring 2021, provided free FIT (fecal immunochemical test) kits and flu vaccines to attendees from the comfort of their own cars. More than 93% of the attendees were Black, a group at increased risk for colorectal cancer as compared with other races.

                    <ul class="standard grey">
                        <li>154 returned their FIT kits for testing</li>

                    <p class="standard grey">
                        The participants with positive results were referred for diagnostic colonoscopies, during which precancerous polyps were removed. Abramson Cancer Center staff assisted some patients who did not have health insurance in finding programs to help pay for their potentially lifesaving procedures.

                            Armenta Washington, MS, senior research coordinator (pictured above), has made it her mission to change that. Soon after joining the Abramson Cancer Center in March 2020, Washington, in collaboration with Associate Director of Diversity and Outreach, Carmen Guerra, MD, MSCE, FACP, started developing the curriculum for the Abramson Cancer Center's inaugural Clinical Trials Ambassador Program. The goal of the program is to educate lay volunteers on cancer and cancer research &mdash; and train them to be ambassadors for clinical trials in their communities.

                        <p class="standard grey">
                            After completing the 10-week program, the first cohort of 19 ambassadors graduated on Oct. 14, 2021. The graduates represent a diverse group of cancer patients, survivors and caregivers representing a wide variety of education levels and socioeconomic backgrounds. Washington, along with colleagues from Abramson Cancer Center and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) led the eight weekly two-hour virtual sessions, during which participants learned:

                        <ul class="standard grey">
                            <li>What cancer is and how it develops</li>
                            <li>Why research is important</li>
                            <li>Why it is necessary to have diversity in clinical trials</li>
                            <li>What type of research is conducted at Abramson Cancer Center</li>
                            <li>What biospecimen research is and how biobanking works</li>
                            <li>About clinical trial patient protections the Abramson Cancer Center has in place</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="standard grey">
                            The program also created clinical trial brochures with messaging tailored specifically to Black people with cancer. A significant portion was dedicated to training participants on how to talk to people in their communities about cancer research, using the brochure to supplement the conversation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="standard grey">
                            "The expectation is that they will, in their natural networks when the conversation comes up, be prepared to engage and talk about what they've learned about clinical trials and encourage patients to have a conversation with their physician," Washington says.
                        </p>
                        <p class="standard grey">
                            Washington and Dr. Guerra are also working on other opportunities for the ambassadors to make a difference, such as inviting them to mentor cancer patients, speaking on panel discussions or providing a patient perspective for grant proposals.

                        In 2013, Sharon was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. After receiving treatment and participating in a clinical trial, the mother of four was one of two women of color enrolled in Abramson Cancer Center's CLEVER study, a Phase II trial looking into the ability of two drugs (hydroxychloroquine and everolimus) to prevent breast cancer recurrences in patients with Disseminated Tumor Cells &mdash; dormant cells that put patients at increased risk for relapse &mdash; by targeting and hopefully destroying them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard grey">
                        "That's when I started looking at data related to race," Sharon recalls. "I discovered that the majority of cancer trial participants are white women."
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard grey">
                        This wasn't a surprise to the Abramson Cancer Center, which has been working for years to increase the number of Black participants in clinical trials. Those efforts have begun to pay off &mdash; the number of Black cancer treatment trial participants has almost doubled, from 12.2% to 23.9% in recent years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard grey">
                        Sharon is determined to help increase those numbers. She has founded two non-profits &mdash; Saving Pennies 4 a Cure, which gives household and personal care items to patients actively receiving chemotherapy; and Trials of Color, whose aim is to bridge the gap between clinical research and people of color through advocacy, education and giving back to the cancer community.

                    <p class="standard grey">
                        Sharon is also a graduate of the Ambassador Program's inaugural cohort, and says the best advice she can give to women of color who have been diagnosed with cancer is to get involved.

                                In 2020, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) once again rated Abramson Cancer Center as "exceptional," the highest possible rating for an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. This is our third straight exceptional rating following an extensive peer-review process for the center's five-year competitive research support grant, which funds work for multiple research and clinical care missions. The recommended funding level for the renewed grant places Abramson Cancer Center among the top 10 cancer center support grant recipients in the country.

                                The exceptional rating also signifies the renewal of Abramson Cancer Center's status as an NCI-designated "comprehensive" center, meaning it remains one of only 51 such centers in the United States and just three in Pennsylvania. This means patients truly have access to the best possible cancer care available across the country. Providing exemplary care has always been part of our story, and we're proud to be recognized by NCI as well as <em><a class="blue" href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/pa/hospital-of-the-university-of-pennsylvania-6231900/cancer" target="_blank">US News & World Report</a></em> for excellence in the care we provide our patients.

                                Developing new treatments for cancer is a lengthy and arduous process. It takes years of research and thousands of hours to develop and test new therapies, many of which never make it to FDA approval. Out of 100 treatments that go to clinical trial, only about six or seven will be successful enough for final approval by the FDA.
