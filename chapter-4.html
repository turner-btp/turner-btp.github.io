                            Penn is home to one of the largest groups of immunologists at any single institution and they continue to push the limits of innovation by building a hub for Immune Health&mdash;performing, curating and analyzing patient immune assays to drive new discoveries and shift the paradigms of clinical care.
                        </p>
                        <p class="standard grey">
                            This starts with integrated data analysis of patient samples, followed by translating that data into clinically actionable immune health information. For example, when COVID-19 first hit, Immune Health was able to deliver results to clinical care teams in real time, ultimately playing a large role in the discovery of new diagnostics and therapies.
                        </p>
                        <p class="standard grey">
                            The immune system is medicine's next great frontier. It senses all tissues in the body. It is the voice that tells us about health and disease, and Immune Health is designed to listen. Just as we can monitor intricate details of the heart via an echocardiogram, an Immune Health profile carries great promise for better understanding and treating disease.
                        </p>
                        <p class="standard grey">
                            Distinct immune signatures are likely found in cancer, infection, autoimmunity, recovery from surgery, preeclampsia, obesity, sleep deprivation, cardiovascular disease, aging and more. A recent Penn Medicine study of immune responses in severely ill COVID-19 patients brought forth important discoveries in COVID care and vaccine strategy, propelling new research in Immune Health. And within the larger ecosystem of the University of Pennsylvania, immunology experts across Penn's 12 esteemed schools are collaborating&mdash;from Penn Engineering to Penn VET.

                                E. John Wherry, PhD, Chair of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics and Director of the Institute for Immunology, has been investigating immune responses in patients critically ill with COVID-19. His goal: To better understand patients' immune responses&mdash;from no response to controlling the virus to causing damage to healthy tissue. Not only does he share these insights with front-line clinicians in real time, he also uses these data to push immunology research forward.

                                Dr. Wherry and colleagues collected samples from COVID-19 patients&mdash;including a cohort with cancer&mdash;then used Immune Health to answer questions related to intensity and type of immune response. The results helped clinical teams interpret and better understand the symptoms they were seeing in patients.

                                The research showed three distinct immune responses to the SARS-CoV2 infection&mdash;patterns that can help predict the trajectory of the disease and inform how best to treat patients.

                                While early studies revealed details on the immune response to the virus, most had been single-case reports or focused on a small group of patients. Dr. Wherry's study is the first comprehensive immune profile of a large number of hospitalized patients. Importantly, 65% of the cohort was African American, accurately reflecting a demographic of those most impacted by the virus - and who could benefit from advanced care.

                                Dr. Wherry's work is also shaping future vaccine strategies. His research revealed people who recovered from COVID-19 had a strong antibody response after the first mRNA vaccine dose and that antibody response did not increase after the second dose. He found those who did not previously have COVID-19 did not have a full immune response until after the second vaccine dose, suggesting a two-dose strategy is the most effective at providing protection from the virus. Their work is helping inform ways to prevent disease in immunocompromised patients&mdash;from cancer to COVID-19 to multiple sclerosis.

"The beautiful thing about Penn is how quickly people with [different types of] expertise stepped in, contributed knowledge, put their feet to the ground, started doing experiments and started helping to set up experiments.

                        Pancreatic cancer accounts for approximately 3% of all cancer diagnoses in the United States, but it is the third most common cause of cancer-related death. Because immune checkpoint inhibitors used for other cancers are largely ineffective for patients with pancreatic cancer, and screenings and early detection methods do not yet exist, it is also notoriously difficult to treat. However, there is hope that cell therapy could play a key role in changing this dynamic and help make strides in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer.

                    <p class="standard grey">
                        The research of Mark O'Hara, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine, focuses on bringing novel immunotherapies to patients with pancreatic cancer through clinical trials. In collaboration with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, which helps fund research across the nation to accelerate the development of breakthrough immunotherapies, Dr. O'Hara tested a combination of a checkpoint inhibitor, an experimental CD40 antibody and chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although still early phase, results were promising, with 83% of patients seeing tumor shrinkage. For the stage four pancreatic cancer patients on the trial&mdash;several of whom underwent therapy for more than a year&mdash;going from a two- to six-month survival outcome to spending any amount of time with friends and family is an immeasurable opportunity.

                        Through the support from a Stand Up to Cancer-Lustgarten Foundation grant, the team is also evaluating CAR-T cell therapy in patients with refractory pancreatic cancer both as a single agent as well as in combination with other novel immunotherapies such as oncolytic adenoviruses. These novel treatment approaches hold promise for bolstering the potential of one's own immune system in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

                        Immunotherapy may hold the answer to expanding our ability to provide the most effective options for our breast cancer patients. Penn Medicine breast surgeon, Julia Tchou, MD, PhD, FACS, launched a clinical trial called BreastVax to explore whether a single dose of immunotherapy&mdash;or immunotherapy with radiation therapy&mdash;before surgery eliminates the disease at an early stage. Her work on this front was inspired by a patient with metastatic melanoma for whom immunotherapy was not working. After being given radiation therapy to relieve pain, his tumors shrank. Researchers believe the radiation therapy made the unresponsive tumor cells vulnerable to the effects of immunotherapy. They are now exploring the potential of this discovery for breast cancer patients.

Daniel Powell, PhD, Associate Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Payal Shah, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine, are working to change that by advancing studies of CAR T-cell therapies in women with recurrent ovarian cancers. The team identified a highly promising target for CAR T-cell therapy&mdash;the protein alpha folate receptor (aFR), which is expressed in 80-90% of ovarian cancers. They have successfully created and administered these aFR-specific CAR T cells in several cohorts of patients in an effort to trigger anti-tumor immunity and achieve clinically meaningful tumor responses.

                        Dr. Huang, who is also a Bridge Scholar through the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, believes these critical data can help inform the best path forward when it comes to utilizing new cancer therapies and improving outcomes&mdash;especially for melanoma, which is the deadliest form of skin cancer.

                    <p class="standard grey">
                        Additionally, the researchers identified patterns in the way melanoma that comes back after surgery can adapt to develop resistance to PD-1 inhibitors, offering even more insight into how to treat patients effectively. The early outlook for this novel therapy is encouraging, and Dr. Huang and his team will continue to explore its potential.
